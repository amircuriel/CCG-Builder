# CCG-Builder
 A development-focused template of a collectible card game.
 
I've created a foundation of flexible rules and mechanics (inspired by the popular CCG "Hearthstone"), to try and support as much mechanical complexity as possible, which can be used to create many different effects and interactions in the game, and can also be easily expanded upon to support additional mechanics, card types and more, without needing to modify the whole architecture.

This is intended to be a template anyone can use or expand upon to create a complex card game with minimal coding and effort.

Currently WIP.
